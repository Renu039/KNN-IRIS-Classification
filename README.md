# Iris Flower Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project focuses on predicting the species of iris flowers based on various features using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm. The dataset used in this project is the famous **Iris dataset** which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to classify iris flowers into three species:
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolor
- Iris Virginica

Based on the features like:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## üìä Dataset

The dataset contains 150 samples with 4 features and a target variable indicating the species of the flower. The dataset is publicly available and often used as a beginner's dataset in machine learning tasks.

### Dataset Columns:
- `SepalLengthCm`: Sepal length in cm
- `SepalWidthCm`: Sepal width in cm
- `PetalLengthCm`: Petal length in cm
- `PetalWidthCm`: Petal width in cm
- `Species`: Target class (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for analysis)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Project

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

### Steps to run the project:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Renu039/knn-iris-classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd knn-iris-classification
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Iris_KNN.ipynb
   ```

## üöÄ Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data and handle any missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize data distributions and correlations.
3. **Model Building**: Implement the KNN algorithm to classify the species based on the features.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics.
5. **Prediction**: Predict the species of new iris flower measurements.

## üìà Results

- **Accuracy**: 95% (Replace with your actual result)
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualize the accuracy of classification
- **Model**: K-Nearest Neighbors classifier (K=5)

## üí° Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning for KNN (adjusting `k` and distance metric).
- Implementing cross-validation for better model reliability.
- Using other machine learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and comparing the results
